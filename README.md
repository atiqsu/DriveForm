## DriveForm

A simple PHP form that submits data (and saves uploaded files) to Google Drive. It currently looks like [this](http://youtu.be/JplnReOPqBs)

This is something that would've been a lot prettier if done in node.js or something similar, but PHP because shared hosts.

Perfect for anything that you'd use [Form+](http://www.formpl.us/) for, but this is completely customizable, self-hosted and without ads.

#### *Work in progress, needs validation, sanitization, an admin panel and tons of other stuff. I wouldn't use it if I were you.*

### What it CAN do, though:

 - Generate a form using data from a JSON file
 - Save form data and
   uploaded files to Google Drive
